## Title: A Frequency-Based Non-Intrusive Watermarking Method

### Abstract: 
Watermarking is key for protecting against art forgery and ensuring photo copyrights, but it often changes the original image so much that it can lower its quality. In this discussion, we're introducing a method of watermarking that works in the frequency domain, providing a less intrusive way of adding protection. This technique aims to safeguard the security and authenticity of digital media without sacrificing the image's original quality.
